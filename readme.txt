Stable tag: 0.7.6

Allow inline editing of your posts and pages from the front end using the styling of your blog.

== Description ==

Adds the capacity to edit your content from the front end of your Wordpress blog using the styling of your blog.

Using the excellent and lightweight [NicEdit](http://nicedit.com "NicEdit") WYSIWYG editor component to give you full control over the look.

The main advantages over editing this way over the traditional method is that you can see your content exactly how it will appear using all the styles and formatting of your Wordpress template, plus it's far more convenient this way.

Please report any bugs, if you don't tell us it how can we fix it? Please include your Wordpress version and other plugins you have installed.

**Known issues**

* Embedded javascript has caused problems, so for the moment this is encoded and displayed between [EncodedJavascript] tags whilst editing.
* Only the main content can be edited. It does not allow you to edit excerpts, titles, comments or other elements yet.
* May not work in IE6/7 or IE8 compatibility mode, update 0.6.13 attempts to resolve this issue but has not been tested on all configurations.
* Your blog must be in UTF-8; `Wordpress Admin->Settings->Reading->Encoding for pages and feed` = UTF-8
* We are aware that this plugin may not work on all configurations, so please contact us directly as we may not notice that you left a comment on Wordpress.org.
